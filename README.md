Overview
In today’s cryptocurrency landscape, blockchain development news is spread across multi- ple sources. As useful as the information is, it requires multiple browser windows opened searching through your favorite web browser with multiple log-ins.
Trying to research altcoins this way is time consuming and requires a lot of effort. And for a cryptocurrency trader, the few minutes’ difference can be the deciding factor whether they can get a good entry price point or not.
How can Funnel tool make your cryptocurrency trading easier?
Funnel Project aims to disrupt this with a single-page app screen with your content in pre-de- signed templates that give you the ability to add your cryptocurrency news sources and social media accounts on one page.
By using templates, you will have the ability to add your content where you want it on a page unique to you.
Integration with existing API for exchanges will allow traders to see multiple exchanges at once.
You can be in your favorite slack and telegram channels at the same time on the same page.
We hope to align ourselves with existing blockchain companies to offer services, news, content and privacy all in one place.
Content management enables you to choose every piece of content on your page. The content could be websites, pages, posts, photos, videos, documents, and just about any other type of data rele- vant to the altcoin that you’re researching.
We will build in APIs for you to add from different services all while providing security to you page to protect what’s important to you.

 
What is Funnel Tool?
Funnel tool is a platform that allows you to create beautiful single funnel for each cryptocur- rency based on blockchain project on your mobile app or web browser. While many platforms only provide a single page service, Funnel tool will be designed specifically for crypto-minded people by crypto-minded people. We will offer a library of pre-built templates and widgets (as well as the ability for you to create your own) using a drag & drop content builder. Funnel platform aims to create fully responsive layouts for both desktop and mobile, with drag & drop functionality, without the need for any design or programming knowledge.
What is Funnel Token?
It is a utility token based on the Ethereum ERC-20 technology that can also be used as a unit of account between advertisers, publishers, and users in Funnel platform. The token is not a digital cur- rency, security or a commodity.

Everything from button colors and size, to space between and space around page elements can be changed. The right platform also allows for the creation of unique themes for specific pages. It will also give the ability for creators to sell their themes to other users.
